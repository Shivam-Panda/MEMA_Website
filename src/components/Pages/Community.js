                    In Troy, Michigan, academic excellence is a hallmark of our community, supported by exceptional teaching staff and a well-structured curriculum. Students have access to a wealth of knowledge in reading analysis, mathematical problem-solving, and scientific reasoning, providing them with a solid foundation for future success. Students are given the opportunity to develop their skills in reading analysis, mathematical problem-solving, and scientific reasoning. These skills are more than enough to help students receive a top-notch education and set them up for success in their future endeavors. In addition to academic excellence, students in Troy benefit from a diverse and inclusive community that fosters cultural awareness and understanding. With students from various backgrounds and ethnicities, come various ideas and perspectives, helping enrich the community. There is also a wide range of extracurricular activities, including sports and cultural activities. However, a major area of concern within the community is the lack of educational engagement within schools. Students tend to lose sight of the application of the profound knowledge that they gain, as evidenced by the confusion faced by high school students in what they want to pursue. The community lacks opportunities for younger students to consistently engage in hands-on skill application, a critical element in fostering curiosity and passion.

                        The community issue that our project aims to address is the prevalent problem of educational disengagement among students. Despite the community’s reputation for academic excellence and access to exceptional educational resources, there exists a significant gap between theoretical learning and practical application, particularly evident among middle and elementary school students. This disconnect undermines students’ motivation and interest in their studies, ultimately hindering their academic progress and future success. This disconnect often stems from a lack of exposure to the real-world applications of what they’re learning. This leads to questions like “Why do we need to know this?” This disengagement not only inhibits their academic progress but also undermines their long-term goals. We’ve chosen to address this issue because we believe that every student deserves the opportunity to explore their interests, connect their learning to real-world scenarios, and ultimately thrive in their future. Removing this issue at the elementary and middle school level will allow the students to grow into passionate high school students, equipped with the knowledge to make educated decisions on what they would like to do in their future.
